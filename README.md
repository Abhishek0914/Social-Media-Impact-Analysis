# Social-Media-Impact-Analysis
This project analyzes how social media usage affects the mental well-being, self-esteem, spending habits, and social behaviors of teenagers and young adults. By using data analytics techniques, we aim to uncover key psychological trends associated with frequent social media use.

Overview
This project explores the psychological and behavioral impact of Instagram using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical hypothesis testing (ANOVA, t-tests, chi-square tests). The goal is to uncover significant patterns in user behavior and psychological effects based on Instagram usage.

üìå Key Objectives
Perform EDA to uncover trends and correlations.
Conduct statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square) to validate key insights.
Visualize the impact of Instagram engagement on psychological and behavioral factors.

üìä Data Overview
The dataset consists of user engagement metrics, psychological impact indicators, and demographic details. Key features analyzed:

Engagement Metrics: Likes, Comments, Followers, Time Spent
Psychological Impact Factors: Anxiety, Self-Esteem, Mood Changes
Demographics: Age, Gender, Region

üß™ Hypothesis Testing
1Ô∏è‚É£ ANOVA: Psychological Impact vs. Instagram Engagement
H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis): There is no significant difference in psychological impact scores across different engagement levels.
H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a significant difference.
Result: p-value < 0.05 suggests a significant impact of Instagram engagement on psychological well-being.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Chi-Square Test: Instagram Usage vs. Mood Changes
Examined whether excessive Instagram usage is statistically associated with mood fluctuations.
Findings: A significant relationship between time spent on Instagram and mood changes, indicating potential emotional effects.

3Ô∏è‚É£ t-Test: Self-Esteem Differences by Instagram Interaction
Compared Self-Esteem Scores between users who actively engage (e.g., posting frequently) vs. those who passively consume content.
Result: A significant difference in self-esteem levels between active and passive users.

üìå Findings & Insights
‚úî High engagement levels on Instagram correlate with mood swings and self-esteem fluctuations.
‚úî Users with excessive time spent on Instagram show statistically significant mood changes.
‚úî Active content creators report higher self-esteem than passive consumers.
